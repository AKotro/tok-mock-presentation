				<section>
					<h2 id="reallifesituationrls">Real Life Situation (RLS)</h2>

					<ul class="smallFont">
						<li><p>2016 was a huge year for artificial intelligence (AI)</p></li>

						<li><p>In January 2016, Google's AI "AlphaGo", created by DeepMind, defeated the world champion Lee Sedol</p></li>

						<li><p>AlphaGo was able to master the game by learning from millions of samples of
							real games</p></li>

						<li><p>Go is said to be the "most complex professional game man has ever devised"</p></li>

						<li><p>Many experts believe that it relies heavily on human <strong>intuition</strong></p></li>

						<li><p>For this reason, this was a very big accomplishment for the world of AIs</p></li>

						<li><p>From this <em>RLS</em> we can extract the knowledge question: "To What Extent Can Artificial Intelligences Be Ethically Treated As Humans?"</p></li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="knowledgeclaim">Knowledge Claim</h2>

					<ul class="smallFont">
						<li><p>Ethics, as an area of knowledge, deals with the morality of human thoughts
							and actions</p></li>

						<li><p>This knowledge question, thus poses an ethical dilemma</p></li>

						<li><p>Historically, many of humans' morally "wrong" actions come from their fear of
							the unknown</p></li>

						<li><p>This is the case for many people when it comes to artificial Intelligences</p></li>

						<li><p>Therefore one knowledge claim that can be made is: "Artificial intelligences
							should never be treated as humans."</p></li>
					</ul>
				</section>

					<section>
						<h2 id="knowledgeclaim-1">Knowledge Claim</h2>

						<ul class="smallFont">
							<li><p>Many highly esteemed scientists, such as Stephen Hawking have expressed their
								fear of possible dominion over humanity by AIs</p></li>

							<li><p>Due to this reason, many believe that AIs should never become socially equal
								to humans</p></li>

							<li><p>Indeed, there are many ethical implications when it comes to the applied
								ethics of dealing with the rights of AIs</p></li>

							<li><p>Take voting rights as an example: to decide if an AI's vote is equal to that
								of a human, we have to examine a sub-knowledge question: "What makes humans
								different than other forms of life?"</p></li>

							<li><p>Technically, a human is a life form that can us the ways of knowing, such as
								sense perception, intuition and reason</p></li>

							<li><p>This allows humans to make ethical decisions and be "smarter in general"</p></li>
						</ul>

				<section>
					<h2 id="counterclaim">Counter Claim</h2>

					<ul class="smallFont">
						<li><p>However, a counter claim "Artificial intelligences <strong>should</strong> be treated as
							humans" can be developed</p></li>

						<li><p>One can argue that already, as seen in the real life situation used,
							artificial intelligences have started to develop certain human qualities</p></li>

						<li><p>From the RLS, AlphaGo was able to use intuition, to come back from
							significant mistake that it had made in the last game against the world
							champion</p></li>

						<li><p>With the rate of growth in the industry of artificial intelligence
							development, it is very likely that AIs will reach a point where they will
							be able to display almost every human quality</p></li>

						<li><p>Then, the only thing left to distinguish between humans and AIs would be
							biological and so there is no reason for AIs not to be treated equally</p></li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2 id="otherreallifesituations">Other Real Life Situations</h2>

					<ul class="smallFont">
						<li><p>In March 2017, Google's DeepMind, the same company that worked on AlphaGo
							developed a program that was able to play 10 classic Atari games on the
							same skill level as a human on its own</p></li>

						<li><p>In October 2016, Microsoft's speech recognition AI was able to be on par with
							a human's performance in a conversational speech task</p></li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

					<ul class="smallFont">
						<li><p>As is evident, Google's AlphaGo has sparked a large ethical dilemma as to the
							moral implications that arise with the development of artificial
							intelligences</p></li>

						<li><p>These advances in artificial intelligence show that in the end, AIs will most
							likley be able to develop and use the same ways of knowing as humans</p></li>

						<li><p>In that case, the first knowledge claim seems to become the right answer,
							which states that AIs should be treated the same as humans</p></li>

						<li><p>However, one cannot predict the future and it is possible that this may never
							happen and that the second knowledge claim, that AIs should never be
							treated the same as humans would apply</p></li>
